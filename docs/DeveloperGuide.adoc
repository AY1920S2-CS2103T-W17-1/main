== Introduction
FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students who are learning a foreign language.

FlashSpeed enhances the revision process by adopting the <<spaced-repetition-system,Space Repetition System>> (SRS) in its design. Users will be tested more frequently on new words, or words that they have gotten wrong in previous sessions.

The main features of FlashSpeed allows users to

* create their own <<deck, decks>> of flashcards (or <<card, cards>>)
* choose a deck to revise (or <<play, play>>) which uses the SRS design mentioned above.

[[Purpose]]

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

FlashSpeed is mainly built on top of a few core components, runner components, and helper components. The core is where
the bulk of the design decisions are made and data processing is performed.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* below gives a high-level overview of the FlashSpeed App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

*The Runners:* +

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At launch: Initializes the core components in the correct sequence, sets up their initial states, and connects them up
with each other.
* At exit: Performs cleanup of components where necessary and shuts down FlashSpeed.

*The Helpers:* +

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following classes plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Writes log messages from many different running components to the FlashSpeed's log file and console.
* `Index` : Provides storage of index numbers and easy conversion between one- and zero-based indices.
* `Messages` : Keeps many user-visible messages for invalid user actions.
* `Exceptions` : Contains different types of specific exceptions which can occur due to invalid user actions.

*The Core:* +

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of FlashSpeed.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data and current state of FlashSpeed in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from and writes data to a data file on the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== 3.1.1 How the core components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the core components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 2`.

.Component interactions for the `remove 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`, `CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MasterParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a card).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remove 2")` API call.

.Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `remove 2` command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `RemoveDeckCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Deck Component within the Model Component
image::ModelClassDeckDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Library data.
* stores and manipulates a `GameManager` object that represents one game session.
* stores and manipulates a `Deck` object that represents the deck that the user is viewing when user is in <<deck-view, deck view>>.
* stores and manipulates a  `Card` object that represents the card that the user is playing with when user is in <<play, play view>>.
* stores and manipulates `View` object that represents the <<view, view>> that the user is currently in.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deck>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save all the decks and cards created in json format and read them back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Selecting a Deck
==== Current Implementation

The `select` command allows user to view the Card content of a Deck. The following syntax is accepted:

`select INDEX`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the index provided. Subsequently, the Card(s) that belongs to the selected Deck will be displayed on the right panel via a `TableView`.

The validation of the arguments in the `select` command is performed in `SelectDeckCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures that the user has entered a valid index (valid data type and range). This is also used for separation of parsing
logic and model management logic.

In `SelectDeckCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the selected Deck is extracted
from the arguments in the `select` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `SelectCardCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index as its parameter.

When `SelectDeckCommand#execute()` is executed a list of currently available Deck is requested from the `ModelManager#getFilteredDeckList()` method. The `ModelManager#selectDeck()` command will be invoked to update the variable that keeps track of the current Deck. After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.

==== Design Considerations
The UI will have to be constantly updated when we select to view a deck, and other decks might be selected afterward. As a result, an `ObservableValue<Deck>` variable will have to be updated constantly via the `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method. Various event listeners are implemented in the UI classes (e.g `CardListPanel`, `DeckListPanel`) in order to instantly react if there is any changes to the selected deck.

=== Creating a Deck
==== Current Implementation

The `create` command allows user to create a new Deck in the current Library. The following syntax is accepted:

`create DECK_NAME`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the index provided. Subsequently, the Card(s) that belongs to the selected Deck will be displayed on the right panel via a `TableView`.

The validation of the arguments in the `create` command is performed in `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures
that the user has entered a non-null deck name.

In `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()`, the `DECK_NAME` of is extracted
from the arguments in the `create` command. The `DECK_NAME` is converted to a Name object. An `CreateDeckCommand`
object is then constructed with the Deck name as its parameter.

When `CreateDeckCommand#execute()` is executed, an empty Deck with the Name parsed in the `CreateDeckCommand` will be
created when the Model Manager invokes the `ModelManager#selectDeck()` command.
After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content
on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the
`MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.


[[Anchor-1]]
==== Design Considerations: Alternative
Initially, both `CreateDeckCommand` and `AddCardCommand` share the same keyword, which is the `add` keyword.
In order to distinguish these two commands from each other,
the Model Manager will check if any deck is currently selected.
If there is, `AddCardCommandParser#parse()` will be called to parse the arguments.
Otherwise, `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()` will be called.

The benefit of this design is that it results in fewer number of command words.
This helps the user on the navigability of the application due to a few number of command words to remember.

However, the glaring disadvantage is that unexpected outcomes are more likely to occur.
For example, assume that the user wants to create a new deck. So, he/she types in the following command:

`create Deck 2`

However, the user has forgotten that a deck is currently being selected.
Therefore, the `AddCardCommandParser#parse()` will be invoked.
This is certainly not the expected outcome that the user has expected.

And so, our team has decided to implement the current approach,
which is to assign different keywords to these two different feature.

=== Creating a Card
==== Current Implementation

The `add` command allows user to create a new Card in the current Deck. The following syntax is accepted:

`add FRONT_VALUE:BACK_VALUE`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the current deck selected.
The Model Manager will be responsible of keeping track of the current deck.
Subsequently, the Model Manager creates a new card  adds it to the current Deck.
The display on the right panel will be updated via updating the `TableView`.

The validation of the arguments in the `add` command is performed in `AddCardCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures
that the user has entered a non-null front value as well as a non-null back value.
The lack thereof will cause a `InvalidFaceValueException` to be thrown.

In `AddCardCommandParser#parse()`, the `FRONT_VALUE` and the `BACK_VALUE` are extracted
from the arguments in the `add` command.
Both values will be converted to a `FrontFace` object and a `BackFace` object respectively.
A `AddCardCommand` object is then constructed with the 'FrontFace' and 'BackFace' objects as its parameters.

When `AddCardCommand#execute()` is called, a `Card` object with the `FrontFace` and `BackFace`
parsed in the `CreateDeckCommand` will be
created when the Model Manager invokes the `ModelManager#addCard()` command.
After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content
on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the
`MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.

==== Design Considerations: Alternative
See <<Anchor-1, 3.2.2>>.

// tag::editcard[]

=== Editing a Card: Shortcut Formats
==== Current Implementation

The `edit` command allows for the values of a Card's face(s) to be changed. There are 3 command formats
accepted:

* `edit INDEX FRONT:BACK` +
* `edit INDEX :BACK` +
* `edit INDEX FRONT:`

This functionality is implemented by replacing the Card to be edited in the Deck with a new Card containing
the new face values (`FRONT` and `BACK`). The shortcut versions of the command (second and third formats above) allows
for one face value of the Card to be edited while preserving the other face value. In this situation, the unedited face
value in the new Card will be a blank string (since either `FRONT` or `BACK` will be a blank string). Subsequently, this
blank value will be replaced by the associated value in the Card to be replaced.

Below is a summary of the operations flow during the editing of a card.

.Operations flow during an Edit command.
image::EditCardActivityDiagram.png[]

The validation of the arguments in the `edit` command is performed in `EditCommandParser#parse()`. Note that
the validation only checks that the command is well-formed, i.e. understandable by FlashSpeed. It does not check for the validity of the command
in the current environment (e.g. if we are currently in Deck view or not). This is for separation of parsing
logic and model management logic.

In `EditCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the card to be edited and the new face value(s) are extracted
from the arguments in the `edit` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `EditCardCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index and the new Card as its parameters.

When `EditCardCommand#execute()` is executed, the environment is then checked. The `edit` command is only valid when
we are currently in a Deck, thus a check on the current view is performed using `ModelManager#getView()`. Then
the Index of the card to be edited is checked by ensuring it is in the range of [0, size of current Deck) using
`ModelManager#getCurrentDeck().getSize()`.

To perform a replacement of a Card in the current Deck, we need the old Card and the new Card. The old Card is required
so we can know which Card is to be replaced via an equality check and also to know the face value which needs to be
preserved (if needed). We can get the Card to be edited using `ModelManager#getCard()` with the provided Index.
The new Card can then be created.
We can then perform the replacement using `ModelManager#replaceCard()` with the old Card and the new Card as the parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sequence of operations due to an `edit` command.

.Operations performed for the `edit 1 fr:bk` command.
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the replacement Card is formed during the start of execution

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A blank string in a face of the new Card means we use the face value in the Card to be replaced.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Can use the extracted values in the arguments as is. Let the final step (`UniqueCardList#replace()`) handle the replacement logic.
** Cons: From `EditCardCommandParser` until the end of the command execution in `LogicManager`, there may exist a Card with a face containing a blank string. May not be a desirable object to have.
* **Alternative 2:** Get the Card to be edited directly in `EditCardCommandParser` so we can immediately produce the new Card with its final face values.
** Pros: The Card to replace the old Card will be fully formed from the start.
** Cons: No separation of parsing and model management logic since we would need to do a view check and get a Card from the current Deck all while in the parser.

// end::editcard[]

// tag::play[]
=== Starting a play session
==== Current Implementation

The `play` command creates a new session to play with a specific deck. The format of the `play` command:
`play INDEX`

The play command changes the mode of the application to `PLAY` mode and creates a new session with the Deck at the given `INDEX`.
The value of the `FRONT` of the selected `Deck` will be displayed to the user.

The first validation of the `play` command is performed in `PlayCommandParser#parse()`.
The validation only checks that the `play` command has the correct format as the `INDEX` argument is given by the user and it is performed on the login level.

In `PlayCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the deck is extracted from the arguments in the `play` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `PlayCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index.

After the object of the `PlayCommand' is constructed, `PlayCommand#execute()` will be executed and the second validation of the `play` command is performed.
This validation firstly checks if the given `INDEX` argument is a non-negative integer and is within the number of cards in the selected Deck. Then the validation checks if
there is any card currently in the selected deck by checking if the `FRONT` face and `BACK` face of the card returned by `ModelManager#play()` are both empty.

A valid `play` command will change the `MODE` of the `ModelManager` to `PLAY` mode and a `GameManager` object will be constructed in `ModelManager`.
The first card of the selected deck is obtained using `deck#asUnmodifiableObservableList().get(0)` and returned to UI. The `FRONT` face of the first card will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `play` operation works.

image::PlaySequenceDiagram.png[]

// tag::flip[]
=== Flipping a Card
==== Current Implementation

The `flip` command flips a card in the selected deck to view the `BACK` face of the card. The format of the `flip` command:
`flip`

The `flip` command displays the `BACK` face of the card that the user is currently playing with to the user so that user is able to check if his or her answer is correct.

An `FlipCommand` object is constructed and `FlipCommand#execute()` is executed. In `FlipCommand#execute()`, validation for the `flip` command is performed.
The validation will check if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode using `ModelManager#getMode()`. if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode, then the validation will check if the card has been flipped
by checking if the returned `BACK` face of the card is empty since a card can only be flipped once.

After that, `ModelManager#flip()` will be executed. In `ModelManager#flip()`, `GameManager#flip()` will be executed and the `BACK` face of the card is obtained using `GameManager#cards.get(counter).getBackFace()` and returned to `ModelManager`.

A valid `flip` command returns the `BACK` face of the card that the user is currently playing to the UI and displays it to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `flip` operation works.

image::FlipSequenceDiagram.png[]

// tag::answer[]
=== Answering in a play session
==== Current Implementation

User answers to the card that he or she is currently playing with using `yes` or `no` command. The formats of the commands are `yes` and `no` respectively.

After flipping the card, users indicates if he or she gets the correct answer by using `yes` and `no` command.

An `AnswerYesCommand` or `AnswerNoCommand` object is constructed and `AnswerYesCommand#execute()` or `AnswerNoCommand#execute()` is executed accordingly. Validation for the `yes` and `no` command is performed to check
if if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode using `ModelManager#getMode()`. if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode, then the validation will check if the card has been flipped
using `ModelManager#getGame().isFlipped()` since a card should not have been flipped before user answers to the card.

After that, `ModelManager#answerYes()` or `ModelManager#answerNo()` will be executed accordingly. In `ModelManager#answerYes()` and `ModelManager#answerNo()`, `GameManager#answerYes()` and `GameManager#answerNo()` will be executed accordingly
and the next card is obtained using `GameManager#cards.get(counter)` and returned to `ModelManager`. `ModelManager` will check if `ModelManager` will check if the session has ended as the user have run through every card in the deck by checking
if the returned card is empty.

A valid `yes` or `no` command returns the next card to the UI and the `FRONT` face of the card is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagrams show how the `yes` and `no` operation work.

image::AnswerYesSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::AnswerNoSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
