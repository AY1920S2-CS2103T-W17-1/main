== Introduction

FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students who are learning a foreign language. University students often have hectic schedules. With this in mind, FlashSpeed was created to allow students to be able to study and revise foreign vocabulary on the fly. With a single command, you can start a quick study session on FlashSpeed whenever!

Keeping, flipping, and tracking physical flashcards can be a pain. FlashSpeed enhances the studying process by having virtual flashcards and a smarter review system. Users will be tested more frequently on flashcards that they had trouble memorizing previously. By using FlashSpeed, you will learn faster and remember for longer!

We hope you enjoy using our app. Happy FlashSpeeding!

The process of creating a deck in FlashSpeed is very simple.

Let's say you want to create a deck to revise some Japanese verbs
to prepare for you upcoming Japanese test.
To do so:

. Firstly, type `create` followed by the deck name into the input box.

****
* *Formal definition*:

The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed decks list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

If you want to view the cards in a particular deck, you can use `select` followed by the deck's index number.
The index number is the number to the left of its name!
After selecting a certain deck, FlashSpeed will enter the Deck view and
show all the cards in that deck. +

In the Deck view, you can use any of the Deck mode commands listed in <<deckViewAnchor, 3.3. Deck view>>.

Note that you don't have to supply both front and back values of a card,
i.e. if you only wish to change the back of a card, the front can be left blank, and vice versa.

Edits the front and back values of the 1st card in the deck to be `ありがとう` and `thanks` respectively.
* `edit 2 :thanks` +
Edits the back value of the 1st card in the deck to be `thanks`.
