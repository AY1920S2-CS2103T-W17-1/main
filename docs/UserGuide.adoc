== Introduction

FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students who are learning a foreign language. University students often have hectic schedules. With this in mind, FlashSpeed was created to allow students to be able to study and revise foreign vocabulary on the fly. With a single command, you can start a quick study session on FlashSpeed whenever!

Keeping, flipping, and tracking physical flashcards can be a pain. FlashSpeed enhances the studying process by having virtual flashcards and a smarter review system. Users will be tested more frequently on flashcards that they had trouble memorizing previously. By using FlashSpeed, you will learn faster and remember for longer!

****
* *Formal definition*: Creates a deck with the deck name specified by the user. The deck name cannot be empty.
****

After downloading and setting up FlashSpeed, you're all set to go!
But before anything else, you will have to first *create a deck*.
The process of creating a deck in FlashSpeed is very simple.

Let's say you want to create a deck to revise some Japanese verbs
to prepare for you upcoming Japanese test.
To do so:

. Firstly, type `create` followed by the deck name into the input box.

+

[[selectDeck]]
==== Selecting a deck : `select`

Format: `select <index>`

* *Formal definition*:
Selects and shows all cards in the deck at the specified `index`.
The `index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed decks list. The `index` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

If you want to view the cards in a particular deck, you can use `select` followed by the deck's index number.
The index number is the number to the left of its name!
After selecting a certain deck, FlashSpeed will enter the Deck view and
show all the cards in that deck. +

In the Deck view, you can use any of the Deck mode commands listed in <<deckViewAnchor, 3.3. Deck view>>.

Example:

* `select 2` +
Selects and shows all cards in the 2nd deck.

[NOTE]
The deck name cannot by empty.

Both the `front` and `back` values cannot be empty.
****
[NOTE]
****

Since a colon is used as the separator, there should not be any colons in the `front` or `back` values.
****

Alright, after creating a new deck and giving it a great name, what's next?
*Adding cards* into that deck, of course!

Once again, the process is easy:

. Select the deck to which you want to add cards, with the `select` command.
+
e.g. `select 1`

. Inside the input box, type:
* `add`, followed by
*  the word/sentence that you want as the front of the card, then
*  a colon ":" right after, and finally
*  the word/sentence that you want as the back of the card.
+
e.g. `add „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:thanks`

. Press kbd:[Enter].
. Voila!

* Existing values will be updated to the given values.
* Empty values for the `front` or `back` will leave the original `front` or `back` intact.
****
[NOTE]
****
* *One and only one* colon (":") can be used in this command.
Since a colon is used as the separator, there should not be any colons in the `front` or `back` values.
****

You can edit the front and/or back values of any card in the current deck. +

[TIP]
You don't have to supply both the `front` and `back` values of a card if you only want to change one of them,
e.g. if you only wish to change the `back` of a card, `front` can be left blank, and vice versa.

Examples:

* `edit 2 „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:thanks` +
Edits the front and back values of the 1st card in the deck to be `„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ` and `thanks` respectively.
* `edit 2 :thanks` +
Edits the back value of the 1st card in the deck to be `thanks`.
* `edit 2 „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:` +

=== Play view

Format: `play <index>`

****
[NOTE]
**Important: All commands in this section can only be used in Play view.**
**To enter Play view, you must <<playDeck,play a deck>>.**

Time to start testing yourself! You can start a game session with a selected deck when you want to test how well you memorize the cards or just to enhance
your memory of the cards in a specific deck. When playing a deck, each card will initially show only its front face to allow you to recall its back face. (It's to test you, after all!)

==== Flipping a card : `flip`

Format: `flip`

Are you ready? When you have a guess which you are confident with of the back face of the card, try to flip the card to see
if your guess is correct. To flip a card to see its back face, simply type `flip` into the input box
and press kbd:[Enter]. +

[NOTE]
You can only do this after flipping the card.

[NOTE]
If you answered `no` for a card, you will have an opportunity to see it again later in the same session.
FlashSpeed optimizes for cards you find difficult.

.The next card (if any) will be immediately shown after answering.

{empty} +

==== Stopping a session: `stop`

Format: `stop`

A play session will end automatically when there are no more cards to review.
However, you can always stop an ongoing session immediately by typing `stop` into the input box and pressing kbd:[Enter].
But of course, don't give up and try not to use this too often!

[NOTE]
The session statistics will be shown after completing a session or even when manually stopping.

[NOTE]
Each card may appear more than once.
You may see the same card a number of times in the same session according to your `yes` or `no` answers.
